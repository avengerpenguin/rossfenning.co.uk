    # Basic info first
    cv:aboutPerson <http://rossfenning.co.uk/#me> ;
    cv:cvTitle "Curriculum Vitae" ;
    cv:cvDescription '''I am currently working as a Principal Software Engineer in
    BBC Future Media with over 11 years' industry experience. My undergraduate degree
    was an MA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge
    and I have recently completed an MSc in Software Engineering and
    Internet Architecture
    run jointly by the University of Bradford and the BBC.
    
I consider myself a general software and "DevOps" engineer with a broad experience across a
    number of languages, services, tools and libraries. I presently have a strong
    interest in REST, RDF, Linked Data and the semantic web as well as development
    process methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, Kanban and BDD.
    
I also have interests in domain modelling, data architecture and systems design.
In June 2014, I published and presented a paper at the CAiSE 2014 conference in
    which I explored using more formal modelling techniques from academia for
    practical, enterprise systems and also touched on parallels between Soft Systems
    Methodology and Agile whilst exploring SSM's use to bring wider context to Agile
    software development practices.
    
My responsibilities in the BBC have been within the main BBC Homepage,
        Search and the global navigation across the website. This has
    allowed me to work with the languages Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and
    JavaScript (including Node.js) in an enterprise setting.''';

                    cv:jobDescription '''In early 2015, I moved to a new "Navigation"
                    project within the same Content Discovery team as the BBC Search
                    product in my previous job title.

This project allowed me to take a position as a main engineer reporting
                    to one product manager and technical lead and working with at most
                    one graduate engineer .
This gave me great opportunity to develop skills
                    and best practices for bootstrapping a new project on
                    Amazon Web Services .

The global nature of navigation across the whole BBC website gave me
                    much opportunity to engage with many teams across the BBC Digital
                    division (now named Design and Engineering).

The combination of taking a principal technical position on the project
                    and my shift to engaging with a lot more of the business side of our
                    work, I was able to achieve an in-role promotion
                    to the title "Principal Software Engineer" .

Internal changes in the wider team have more recently expanded my remit
                    as one of two principal engineers across all of BBC Homepage, Search
                    and the global navigation.
My role now has more emphasis on supporting three
                    teams of engineers, facilitating technical decisions with my experience
                    and taking some ownership of forthcoming work on
                    the roadmap that has strong need for technical
                    input and championing to the right people in the
                    business.

search functionality as part of the Content Discovery team within BBC Future
Media. My role is part of a development team working with a Kanban methodology
to deliver high-quality web services that collect, index and query across
all BBC online content.

The spread of technologies, domains and systems involve lead to a classic
Enterprise Integration project, but in my role I have been driving to lead on
introducing principles from REST architectures (e.g. HATEOAS, hypermedia)
and even Linked Data to create long-running and evolvable service applications,
which minimises the amount of bespoke integration code required.

The project is primarily written in Java, with Ruby used extensively for
integration and acceptance testing of services. The search page itself uses
PHP and Javascript, but the bulk of the work is in the Java applications that
acquire and process the data. We use Spring and JAX-RS (Jersey) for individual
services, with some use of Apache Camel and ActiveMQ where appropriate.''';
