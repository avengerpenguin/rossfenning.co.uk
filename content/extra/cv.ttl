    cv:cvDescription """I am a principal software engineer with a holistic
approach to DevOps, Agile and software delivery.
This includes both building software and the human side of how to get teams to
ship code quickly. In my current role, I focus mainly
on technical leadership, disruption and getting the best out of engineers in
combination with optimising our deployment pipelines.

More recently, I have been working in partnership with data analysts and data
scientists to improve the analytics feedback loops for the BBC online audience
and applying data modelling and prototyping techniques to this problem. I
therefore have some familiarity with data science and machine learning tools
such as Jupyter, numpy and scikit-learn.

In my personal time I play music (bodhr√°n and tin whistle), work a little
on personal, open source projects and study philosophy, languages, computer
science and other various fields of interest.

My current role is one of two Principal Software Engineers supporting four teams
within the Search and Navigation department (renamed from previous
name of "Content Discovery") within BBC Design and Engineering.

My role is a balance between stepping back from implementations
-- giving only support and domain knowledge to other engineers where needed --
and also doing more "hands on" technical work when it comes to prototyping
or in the DevOps and deployment automation domain.

I have also been involved in architectural
design and data modelling for improving our pan-website analytics and work to
improve our tracking beyond simple impressions and clicks, e.g. user engagement
tracking and audience demographics.

with minimal bespoke integration code.
Technologies were primarily Java, JAX-RS (Jersey), Apache Camel and ActiveMQ.
Ruby and Cucumber was used for component tests.
