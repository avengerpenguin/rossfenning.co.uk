    cv:cvTitle "Curriculum Vitae" ;
    cv:cvDescription '''I am primarily a software engineer and web developer (Python, Java, PHP) with
6 years experience in the industry backed by a degree in Computer Science.
This gives me an methodical, yet adaptable, creative and innovative approach
to problem solving. I also have experience in maintaining GNU/Linux and Unix
systems (Apache, MySQL, Postfix, LDAP).

I have a passion for seeking new challenges with new projects -- I enjoy
keeping  up to date with emerging technologies and techniques so as to be able
to find and apply the best solution to any given problem.

My team personality is a balance between a methodical and logical problem
solving approach and initiating new ideas. I like to think anything can be
achieved with the proper planning and creative thinking. I thrive where new
ideas and communication are encouraged.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the BBC on the Homepage and
Location Services search products and am looking for any further contract
or freelance opportunities as of the beginning of February 2012.''' ;
