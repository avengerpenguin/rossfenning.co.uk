    # Basic info first
    cv:aboutPerson <http://rossfenning.co.uk/#me> ;
    cv:cvTitle "Curriculum Vitae" ;
    cv:cvDescription '''I am currently working as a Senior Software Enginner in
BBC Future Media with 10 years' industry experience. My undegraduate degree was
in Computer Science and I am enrolled in a Software Engineer MSc degree run
jointly by the University of Bradford and the BBC.

I consider myself a general software engineer with a broad experience across
a number of languages, services, tools and libraries. I presently have a strong
interest in RDF, Linked Data and the semantic web as well as development process
methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, Kanban and BDD.

I also have interests in domain modelling, data architecture and systems design.
In June 2014, I published and presented a paper at the CAiSE 2014 conference
in which I explored using more formal modelling techniques from academia for
practical, enterprise systems and also touched on parallels between
Soft Systems Methodology and Agile whilst exploring SSM's use to bring
wider context to Agile software development practices.

My present role involves developing Java-based RESTful web services for the
BBC website's search and previously I have worked on the main home page and
also the location search used by parts of the website such as BBC Weather. I have
worked with Java libraries such as Jersey, Apache CXF, Apache Camel, Lucene
and services such as ActiveMQ, Solr, Elasticsearch and Apache Tomcat.

Previous projects have allowed me to work with PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS and
I am beginning to pick up Scala and the Play framework. I use Ruby substantially
for integration and acceptance testing and Python for supporting scripts and tools.
I use Python and both Django and Flask for all personal projects and I am
active in Python community events such as PyCon UK and Python User Group
meetups.''';

search functionality as part of the Content Discovery team within BBC Future
Media. My role is part of a development team working with a Kanban methodology
to deliver high-quality web services that collect, index and query across
all BBC online content.

The spread of technologies, domains and systems involve lead to a classic
Enterprise Integration project, but in my role I have been driving to lead on
introducing principles from REST architectures (e.g. HATEOAS, hypermedia)
and even Linked Data to create long-running and evolvable service applications,
which minimises the amount of bespoke integration code required.

The project is primarily written in Java, with Ruby used extensively for
integration and acceptance testing of services. The search page itself uses
PHP and Javascript, but the bulk of the work is in the Java applications that
acquire and process the data. We use Spring and JAX-RS (Jersey) for individual
services, with some use of Apache Camel and ActiveMQ where appropriate.''';
